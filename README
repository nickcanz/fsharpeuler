Part of the process of learning any language is using it. 
I decided to learn F# and the Project Euler problems really seemed to 
fit that.

Developed on an Ubuntu box using Mono.

In each problem folder, run the file without any letters after the name,
so 'pe3.fs' for problem three. 'pe3X.fs' are things that I tried out
beforehand, so you might get an idea for how I think. But probably not.
